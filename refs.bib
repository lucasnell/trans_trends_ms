The standard approach estimates the finite rate of population growth (?) from a set of vital rates. In some instances, an estimate of ? is available, but the vital rates are poorly understood and can be solved for using an inverse matrix approach. However, these approaches are rarely attempted due to prerequisites of information on the structure of age or stage classes.
